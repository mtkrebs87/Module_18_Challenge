Two files were used when analyzing the data from Citi Bike. Using this data I was able to answer the following quesstions:  

What were the top 10 starting stations for Citi Bike in these years?  
What were the top 10 destination stations for Citi Bike in these years?  
Who uses Citi Bike more? Subscribers? Or Customers ("customers" refers to individuals who do not subscribe to Citi Bike)?  
What are the longest trip durations by destination for Citi Bike users?  
Which bikes likely require maintenance?  

The Map Dashboard shows the top origin sites and top destination sites for Citi Bike users. Here the larger and darker circles indicate which origin or destination sites are most popular in Jersey City. Unsurprisingly, the sites that have the larger and darker circles are near the downtown area of Jersey City. Some notable outliers include "Sip Ave", "Liberty Light Rail", and "Newport Pkwy/Path" areas. Otherwise, the heavy use areas by both origin and destination are in the 07302 zip code.   

The Top Origin/Destinations dashboard examines the top 10 origin and destination sites along with the average trip duration. For both bar graphs, the top 9 sites for both are the same, with some minor placement differences such as "Hamilton Park" and "Exchange Place" changing the descending order by one spot on each graph. The other notable difference is the 10th place holder is different for each bar graph - "Morris Canal" is a top origin site and "Warren St" is the 10th place holder for destinations.     
Then, we can see the total average trip duration with the start and end stations listed when hovering over the respective bubble. Each bubble lists the Origin Site first then the destination site. Bubble colors are determined by the end station. When hovering over the bubbles you can see the total average trip duration, which also coordinates with the size of the bubble. This shows us the top origin to destination combinations users are frequenting. This chart can also be adjusted with the slider to filter the data by total average trip durtation changing which bubbles appear.  

In Trip Duration dashboard we examine who is using Citi Bike. The horizontal stacked bar graph shows who uses Citi Bike the most - Subcribers or Customers. Examining the graph shows that Subscribers are the heaviest user, which is no surprise. The line graph shows the total trip duration by age. This helps show a demographic layer of users for Citi Bike. These two visualizations together show us that the heaviest users are subscribers born in the years 1969 and 1988. Interestingly, the line graph shows us that younger riders are using the bikes LESS than older users. However, we have a limited dataset which may contribute to skewed data.  

Along with the forementioned data we have a treemap that shows which bikes have been used the most - suggesting that those bikes should be first to be maintained.

Overall the Citi Bike initiative appears to be a success, even with the limited data used for this investigation. Using more data more frequently would help us paint a clearer picture of our top demographics, our highest volume hours, and which locations are the most popular.
